It would be nice to be able to use Theano from other languages.
This requires two things: a way to communicate the expression to the theano
compiler, and a way to pass data to and from the compiled function.

One way to do this would be define a textual representation of theano graphs.
A Scheme-like language seems appropriate.  Perhaps just scheme would be
appropriate.


How to pass shared variables?
