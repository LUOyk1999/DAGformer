MongoDB DLL Cache
=================


In network environments (like at DIRO on NFS3), a distributed DB like mongo or couch is faster and more
robust to concurrency than the $HOME/.theano.  Also, a single cache could be
shared by multiple users.  This would result in less compilation time, for
everyone, and less stale-cache problems.
