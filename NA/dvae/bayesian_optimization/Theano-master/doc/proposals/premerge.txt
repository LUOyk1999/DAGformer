Proactive Merging
=================


Merge is done now as an optimization. 
But if Merging was done at graph construction time, things like #476 would work.
Additionally, memo-izing at graph construction time would make it possible to
define recursive formula with recursive python functions (e.g. Fibonacci).
Currently the merge optimization would make the Fibonacci series linear, but the
size of the program used to express the program would be exponential.
