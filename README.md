# Transformer over Directed Acyclic Graph 

The repository implements the Transformer over Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG transformer) in Pytorch Geometric described in [Transformer over Directed Acyclic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13148).

## Installation
Tested with Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.13.1, and PyTorch Geometric 2.3.1.

The dependencies are managed by [conda]:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Overview
